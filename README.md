### NAME PENDING

The purpose of this project is to create a top-down 2d dungeon crawler-style game with basic features.
Inspired by games like GTA 1 and The Binding of Isaac, it will have simple WASD controls and have pixel art graphics.

Hopefully it'll be great (not likely) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Made by Hannes and Konrad, and also maybe some enslaved pixel artists (´･ω･\`)
