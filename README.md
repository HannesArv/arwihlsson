### Nova

The purpose of this project is to create a basic, top down view action/dungeon crawler game in Java, similar
to the Binding of Isaac, old school Grand Theft Auto, or Zelda. In our project we aim towards creating
a playable character, which the player can control relatively smoothly with WASD-type keyboard controls. We
wish to include basic collision detection, some kind of monster/antagonist to defeat, and mechanics that
allow for adding more rooms and creating a more dynamic adventure.

### Testing

Since the game will have very simple features to begin with (and has a graphical interface) we suspect that
real time playing of it will suffice for trial and error; trying out edge cases in collision mechanics, for
example. Should the project become more complex, we plan on using Junit for more sophisticated debug.
Another path one might explore is hotswapping, aka real time debugging.

### Installation

We plan on making a runnable .jar file which one can download and play directly.
